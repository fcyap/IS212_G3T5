# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Smart Task Manager/Productivity System seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to the project maintainers with:
- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Possible impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Response**: We will provide an initial response within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress every 7 days until resolution
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:
1. Confirm the vulnerability and determine its severity
2. Work on a fix and prepare security updates
3. Coordinate the release timing with you
4. Credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update npm packages using `npm audit` and `npm update`
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit `.env` files containing sensitive data
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
- **Strong Authentication**: Use strong passwords and enable 2FA where available

### For Contributors

- **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices and validate all user inputs
- **Dependency Security**: Review third-party packages before adding them as dependencies
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
- **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suites

## Known Security Considerations

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **CORS Configuration**: CORS is properly configured for production environments
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs should be validated and sanitized
- **Database Security**: Using Supabase with proper authentication and authorization
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables

### Frontend (Next.js/React)
- **XSS Prevention**: Using React's built-in XSS protection and proper input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Implementing appropriate CSRF protections for state-changing operations
- **Content Security Policy**: Consider implementing CSP headers
- **Secure Headers**: Ensure security headers are properly configured

## Dependencies Security

### Regular Security Updates
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities
- Use `npm audit fix` to automatically fix issues where possible
- Monitor security advisories for all dependencies

### Key Dependencies Monitored
- Express.js and middleware packages
- Supabase client library
- Next.js framework
- Radix UI components
- Form validation libraries

## Infrastructure Security

### Database (Supabase)
- Database access restricted through Row Level Security (RLS)
- API keys properly managed and rotated
- Connection strings secured in environment variables

### Deployment
- Secure environment variable management
- Regular security updates for hosting platforms
- HTTPS enforcement
- Proper access controls

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Security vulnerabilities are fixed before public disclosure
- Reporters are credited appropriately
- Security advisories are published when appropriate
- Users are notified of security updates

## Security Contact

For security-related questions or concerns that are not vulnerabilities, you can reach out through:
- GitHub Issues (for non-sensitive security questions)
- Project maintainer email addresses listed in package.json
